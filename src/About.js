                    Welcome to TransparentUni! We are a resource for prospective college students to connect with current college students
                    and get questions answered about mental health and disability accommodations and accessibility on campus. We hope to establish
                    a community of current college students with accommodations who are willing to share their experiences and be mentors for prospective
                    students who are looking for similar accommodations when they attend college.
